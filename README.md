This is my project description.

Assalamu Alaikum In this app, first we can see three onboarding skins according to Figma design and we can see a location skin, where it will take the user's current location and show it in the form of an address on the home screen, then there will be an option below from where we can click on the Add Alarm button to pick the date and time and save it in the list view of the home screen, as soon as the alarm is set, a notification will come, and at the time the alarm is added, the alarm notification will sound at the specific time, if you want, you can turn the alarm on or off by clicking on the toggle option, and if you want, you can delete it by scrolling to the left side, thank you
